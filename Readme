The progress of the Hordes of Tarshish client from java to javascript.
Medium: png

Recently, it has come to my attention that it is feasible to use javascript,
along with WebSockets or a Java shim, to write the Hordes of Tarshish client.
Since learning that, I started rewriting the client.  This shows the
evolution from java to javascript, and the speed that I am able to convert it.

For some reference, it took me weeks to get the half working interface that
is currently in the java client.  It took me a weekend to redo the interface
with jQueryUI, and it already works much better than the java version.
